        Think of today as a restorative time for yourself in which you can come to a point of greater ease and comfort, Sagittarius. Trust yourself and the people around you.

        Pure wisdom is an important quality for you to aspire to on this day, Leo. Know that the wisdom you seek should come from a point of calm knowing and strength as opposed to a frantic, loud, and outlandish display for attention. You'll be recognized accordingly. Be aware that the more knowledge you spread to others, the more it will grow for everyone to profit by and share.

        Make sure that you're living consciously at this time, Aries. It could be that you're going through a period of denial and simply refusing to see the truth of the situation. Open up your eyes to the world around you so you can invite in joy and compassion. Don't be satisfied with superficial interactions that don't really satisfy you emotionally and intellectually.

        You may find yourself gravitating toward solid, grounded things, Capricorn, in hopes that these will provide you with the stability that you lack. A key word for you today is patience. Learn how to wait without becoming restless or grumpy. What you will discover after a while is that the stability you seek is actually sitting right there inside of you, and has been all along.

        Why keep fighting a fight that you know you can't win, Virgo? Why keep trying to fool yourself and others into thinking that you have all the answers when you're only aware of the tip of the iceberg? The mass of knowledge lies well beneath the surface. Instead of fighting, offer to surrender. At this point, others will be much more willing to quench your thirst for truth. The key for you is to listen.

Perhaps you harbor a sense of shame based on past events that still linger in your mind. Don't let this shadow of insecurity continue to dwell in your life. Work through these feelings and identify the root of the problem.

Rid yourself of the excess baggage that you cling to as some sort of support or means of comfort. The less you carry, the more you free up your arms to create.

The more you see love in the people around you, even in the heart of a stranger, the more you'll be blessed with its radiant light.
